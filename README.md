# Tech-Blog
This is my fourteenth challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this challenge, I use Sequelize, Express.js, and Handlebars.js to build a fullstack application that follows the MVC Paradigm. Users can create posts, edit posts, and comment on other's posts in this wordpress-type website. 

.env file format: 
```
DB_NAME="tech-blog"
DB_USER="your-mysql-username"
DB_PW="your-mysql-password"
```
